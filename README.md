Server-Client Flask Communication in Linux Box

This repository contains a simple implementation of server-client communication using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The server accepts POST requests with commands, executes them, and returns the result to the client.

Server

Description
The server is implemented using Flask, a micro web framework for Python. It exposes a single endpoint /api/command to receive POST requests containing commands to execute. Upon receiving a command, the server executes it using the subprocess module, captures the output, and returns it as a JSON response.

Setup
Install Flask: pip install Flask
Run the server: python server.py
Usage
Send POST requests to http://localhost:5000/api/command with JSON payload containing the command to execute.
The server will execute the command and return the result as JSON.
Client

Description
The client is a simple script that sends POST requests to the server with commands to execute. It uses the requests library to make HTTP requests to the server.

Setup
Install requests: pip install requests
Usage
Run the client script: python client.py
Enter commands when prompted. Type exit to quit.
Example

Start the server: python server.py
Run the client script: python client.py
Enter commands when prompted. For example:
bash
Copy code
Enter command (type "exit" to quit): ls
This will list the files in the server's directory.
The client will display the output of the command returned by the server.
